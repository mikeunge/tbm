# Taskbook-Manager
Taskbook-Manager (*tbm*) is an extension to the [taskbook](https://github.com/klaussinani/taskbook) **cli** program from
[@klaussinani](https://github.com/klaussinani).

I **LOVE** (♥️) the idea of having my taskbook/todo-list in the terminal because that's where I spend my days in. The
program works fine but it's features are a bit restricted. Like, I **cannot** create another taskbook for, let's say, a
project I'm working on or share a existing taskbook with one of my coworkers.

Because of this I created tbm. It takes the taskbook program and enhances it's features as I need.

### Before we start
Before you can run the script, make sure you have an existiting .taskbook folder in your homedirectory
($HOME/.taskbook) and already created a taskbook.
